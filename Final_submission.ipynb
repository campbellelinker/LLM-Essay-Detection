    "- Insert Markdown chunks for your written responses as needed\n",
    "- Do not include unnecessary code. Only code that is needed to answer the questions should be included, nothing more. \n",
    "- Be sure your work is **reproducible** by \"Restart and Clear Output\" then \"Run All\" cells\n",
    "- The group leader will make a single submission on Moodle on behalf of the group. \n",
    "- **ACKNOWELDGE ALL EXTERNAL SOURCES HERE:** Give a brief summary of any external sources you used. \n",
    "    - See works cited in our write up for sources we used for **conceptual background** (e.g., TF-IDF). Below, we are including the sources we used to support our **coding process.**\n",
    "        - Sophia: [EDA for feature engineering](https://pankaj8blr.medium.com/eda-and-significance-of-various-plots-in-feature-engineering-f8cededbd520)\n",
    "        - Sophia: [EDA Seaborn Boxplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html)\n",
    "        - Cam: [**PySpellChecker**](https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/) was used in our original feature engineering, but we abandoned the idea in our final model as the numeric values were not calculated with appropriate sensitivity. We struggled with over/under detection of true spelling errors. However, when we were using this as a feature engineering step, we followed the previously linked website and [this site](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/spelling-checker-in-python/) for guidance with building the package into a function.\n",
    "        - Cam: We made frequent references to the [**discussion page**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/discussion?sort=hotness) of the Kaggle competition. Nothing on this page informed our code, but we did use it for reccomendations in using TF-IDF and identifying data. Multiple threads inspired our decisions but none influenced code.\n",
    "        - Cam: I referenced **Google AI Overview** for how to sequence out our preprocessing pipeline, once we incorporated TF-IDF. There were a few key conceptual and code takeaways from this search, I found it to be a helpful synthesis of information appearing across multiple sites:\n",
    "            - The scaling step (we used MaxAbsScaler) should NOT be applied to the TF-IDF columns. This is why we divided our preproccessing pipeline into two sections.\n",
    "            - The first section handles our NLP step. Google AI Overview suggested pseudocode for how to combine the text and character vectorizer steps into one, such that they can be used in the preprocessing pipeline. [FeatureUnion()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion.html) was suggested, and we referenced the function documentation and [this page](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/55544) for how to use it when combining NLP text features. The NLP step functions as a transformer to the original text data in this preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "            - The next section handles our human-feature engineering. It takes `our_features` and scales them. We knew how to do this step from class but Google AI Overview provided direction in how to combine this step with new information regarding NLP.\n",
    "        - Cam: I did a lot of research about parameters for each of our models. We struggled with a lot of overfitting and I wasn't sure which parameters would be best at addressing this issue. Google AI Overview came up with each search but did not produce anything helpful. These were the **websites** I found most helpful in this process:\n",
    "            - [XGBoost Parameter tuning - \"Control Overfitting\"](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/param_tuning.html)\n",
    "            - [Random Forrest](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/random-forest-hyperparameter-tuning-in-python/) -- We abandoned this model pretty early on\n",
    "            - [Logisitc Regression Parameter tuning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21816346/fine-tuning-parameters-in-logistic-regression) - helpful for a review from class, though there was not much to experiment with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note** that our EDA step was moved to come after feature engineering."
